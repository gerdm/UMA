\chapter{Financial Markets}
Throughout modern history, the value of \textit{anything} has been of great importance. To set the value of exchange in a transaction, any two parties involved must agree in the current worth of whatever it is that will be transacted, and take opposite sides of interest in it\footnote{In other words, one party wants to buy (obtain) and the other to sell (get rid off)}. Furthermore, these two parties require to communicate, and be able to find one another or a third whose worth of the \textit{something} at play favors any one of them more.\\

This \textit{something} at play, in financial terms, is called a \textbf{security}. We define a security as an instrument that either represents ownership or that derives its value from a commodity. We say that a security is \textbf{fungible} if any unit of the instrument is economically indistinguishable from all other units. That is, whomever buys (or sells) the instrument can pay any unit at the same price at a given point in time.\\

The problem of searching for the price and the party whose view on the value of a security reflect ours is called \textbf{trading}. A \textbf{market} is the place where buyers meet sellers. Markets can be both a physical place (called a trading floor), or an electronic system.

\section{The Participants}
In a financial market, participants have various reasons to trade. On the one hand there is the \textbf{buy-side}. They trade in order to solve a financial problem originated outside of the market. This group sees the market as a means to an end, and thus, they rely on the resources available in the market.\\

 On the other hand are the participants who offer exchange services to the buy-side. Their trading purpose is to satisfy the needs of the buy-side by taking the opposite side of the trade. This group sells exchange services to the buy-side, consequently they are known as the \textbf{sell-side}.\\

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c c m{3cm}}
    	\hline
    	Trader Type & Examples & Why They Trade \\
    	\hline
    	Dealer & \breakcell{Market Maker \\ Specialist \\ Floor Trader \\ Locals \\ Day traders \\ Scalpers} & {To earn trading profits by supplying liquidity} \\
    	\\  	
    	Brokers & \breakcell{Retail brokers \\ Discount brokers \\ Full-service brokers \\ Institutional Brokers \\ Block brokers \\ Futures commission merchants} & {To earn commissions by arranging trades for clients} \\
    	\\
    	Broker-dealers & \breakcell{Wirehouses} & {To earn profits and trading commissions} \\
    	\hline
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

We can classify the buy-side and the sell-side as those who require liquidity and as those who provide it. \textbf{Liquidity} is an important concept in financial markets. Although the term itself can be regarded in many ways, we will denote it as the likelihood of trading constraint to units available, price offered and time.

\section{The Instruments}
Financial instruments can be categorized into two mayor classifications: basic securities and derivatives (or financial contracts).
