# Mortable
An educational actuarial project to analyse the data from a given mortality table. Currently the project requires the use of a .csv file as as an input with an <b> age </b> column on the left of the table and <b> mx </b> data on the left column. Further improvements will be made.

## The terminal application
The project includes a terminal application which, at the moment:

  * Calculates and plots mortality table functions.
  * Approximates the table using the Makeham model and plots the results.
